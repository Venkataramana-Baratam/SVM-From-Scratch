# 🧠 Building Support Vector Machine From Scratch

This project contains a Python implementation of a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier from scratch using only basic libraries like `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

---

## 📌 Overview

Support Vector Machines are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. This notebook walks through the theory and code required to implement an SVM step-by-step without using external ML libraries such as scikit-learn.
